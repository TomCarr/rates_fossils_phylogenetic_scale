**[fossil_deposition_prob.R](https://github.com/TomCarr/rates_fossils_phylogenetic_scale/blob/main/fossil_deposition_prob.R):** Get probability of sampling a fossil calibration through time according to a constant rate birth death branching process

**[fossil_character_decay.R](https://github.com/TomCarr/rates_fossils_phylogenetic_scale/blob/main/fossil_character_decay.R):** Get probability of sampling a fossil calibration through time, but accounting for incomplete character preservation

**[fossil_rate_likelihood.R](https://github.com/TomCarr/rates_fossils_phylogenetic_scale/blob/main/fossil_rate_likelihood.R):** Get rate variation in fossil sampling required for a given set of fossil calibrations
